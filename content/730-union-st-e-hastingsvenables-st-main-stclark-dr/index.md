A free store.  Big, open tables of free items: books, clothes, household items, stationery, toys, etc.  
In front of co-op housing.  
As the goods are not covered, they might not be available when it is raining.  Might be closed at night, too.  Or maybe they leave out the items that are water-proof, such as metal, plastic, glass, and pottery.
Don't donate at night, a notice says.  
It also says to retrieve your donations if not taken—after an unstated period.  
Not sure how serious that is.  
But don't trash what you take back.  
Instead, you can donate them elsewhere.
For instance, donate them to one of the 11 other free stores in Vancouver, now marked with dark blue markers on this map, for your convenience.
