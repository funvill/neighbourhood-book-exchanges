# Our Amazing Park Adventure!

Emma and I had such a wonderful time working on Stage 2 of the Great Park Treasure Hunt today! What started as a simple afternoon walk turned into an exciting detective mission.

## Emma's Observations (age 8)

*Mom helped me write this part:*

The puzzle asked us to count different things in the park. I found:
- 7 different types of flowers (Mom helped me identify them)
- 3 red park benches
- 12 oak trees (they have funny-shaped leaves!)
- 1 very friendly squirrel who watched us work

The math part was easy once we found all the numbers. 7 + 3 + 12 + 1 = 23, and that led us to check post #23 on the exercise trail!

## What We Learned

This puzzle was perfect for Emma's age level. It combined:
- Basic addition and counting skills
- Nature identification
- Physical activity (we walked almost 2 miles!)
- Problem-solving as a team

The hidden compartment in exercise post #23 contained the most beautiful hand-drawn map of the park with the next clue. Emma was so proud when she figured out where to look next!

## Tips for Other Families

- Bring snacks and water - we got hungry halfway through!
- A magnifying glass helps with reading small clues
- Let kids lead when they're confident, but be ready to help
- Take photos of your discoveries - Emma loves showing her dad later

## What's Next

We found a clue about "where the ducks gather for their evening meeting." Emma thinks it's the pond, but I suspect it might be more specific than that. We're planning to return tomorrow evening to observe the ducks and continue our adventure!

## Community Love

Thank you to whoever maintains this library and creates these wonderful family experiences. As a single mom, finding activities that challenge Emma intellectually while keeping her engaged is not always easy. This has become our new favorite weekend tradition!
