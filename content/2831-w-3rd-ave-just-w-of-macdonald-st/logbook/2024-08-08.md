## Description from Original Source

Little Pink Book Exchange.
With chair.  In honour of Leah and Carl Lehan who loved both books and Kitsilano.  
Now added a second cupboard, making 9 shelves altogether.  
Narrow shelves, so the books cannot be too big.  
Mostly 'pocket book' size.
— Later revised by K.D.
