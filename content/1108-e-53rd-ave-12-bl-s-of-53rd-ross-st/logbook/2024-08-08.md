## Description from Original Source

Reported by Craig B., May 2020.

More from K.D.:
This book exchange WAS 2 little old unmarked unpowered fridges, but they are gone, replaced with 2 typical little house-shaped libraries some time before 2025 4 17.
This address is of the closest house, though that house might have no connexion to the little library.
Ross Street is half-way between Fraser and Knight Streets, just w. of Inverness Street.
On the s.w. corner of the 1108 property.
In the lane, w. of that house.
The city government says that that lane is not named, but it is labelled as Ross St. on this map. 
That lane is just one block long.  
It looks like a typical, narrow (one-lane wide) back lane between the sides of the 4 adjacent houses on this block.  
Between E. 53rd and 54th Ave.
The rest of Ross Street is a regular-width n.-s. street.  

If coming instead from the south (E. 54th Ave.), go n. 1/2 block n. of 54th on that lane.
That lane is not a through street on this block for cars, just for pedestrians and cyclists.
