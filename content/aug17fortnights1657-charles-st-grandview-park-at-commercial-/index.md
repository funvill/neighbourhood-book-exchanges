Is this event still going??
'The Vancouver Free Market'.
Books and everything else free.
Alternating Sundays (once every 2 weeks), 
noon to 4 pm.

2025 August 17.
2025 August 31.
2025 September 14.
2025 September 28, etc.

Like a yard sale without paying and with politics. Bring and take.
Outdoors in the east-central part of 
Grandview Park, close to Commercial Dr..   
If it rains, I think that people bring canopies.
The dates of this are 2 weeks (one fortnight) apart.  
(Also, maybe alternating Sundays with 
the New Westminster Free Market.)
Schedule subject to change.

If there are books left over, you can save them for the next event or donate them to Little Free Libraries and book exchanges, etc. 
The 3 closest, as on this map, are:
1780 Napier St. at Salsbury Dr.
1445 Salsbury St. at Grant St.
1520 Cotton Dr., north of 1st Ave.

Left-over non-library items can be put into the free stores, which now have dark blue markers on this map.  The best one which is close is at 2336 Charles St., about 5 blocks due east of here.  The other 3 close ones are small.
