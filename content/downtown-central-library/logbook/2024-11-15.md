# Found the Missing Piece!

After two weeks of puzzling over the third case in the Downtown Detective Series, I finally cracked the building cipher! The key was realizing that the architectural details weren't just decorative - they were actually encoding the next location.

## What I Discovered

The gargoyles on the old courthouse aren't just for show. Each one represents a different letter based on their positioning relative to the building's compass orientation. Once I mapped out the pattern, it spelled out "BENEATH THE STEPS" which led me to find the next clue hidden under the main courthouse staircase.

## Hints for Future Solvers

- Bring a compass or use your phone's compass app
- The morning light reveals details that aren't visible in the afternoon
- Count everything - windows, columns, decorative elements
- Don't forget to look up!

## Next Steps

The clue I found leads to the old library downtown (the big one, not this little library). I think this mystery connects to at least three different locations around the city. Planning to tackle the next part this weekend.

## Thanks

Shoutout to whoever left the subtle pencil mark on page 12 of the detective notebook - that tiny arrow pointing to the architecture section was exactly the nudge I needed! This community is amazing.
