This library was created by importing data from "Neighbourhood book exchanges 2025.8.6" - a comprehensive map of little free libraries and book exchanges in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Original Data

- **Source**: Vancouver Little Libraries KML dataset

- **Import Date**: August 8, 2025

## Description from Original Source

North of the western edge of Hastings Park 
(the PNE).
Just to the right of the home's door.
Small, 1 shelf.
As there is no door to repel the rain, wrap each book in its own clear plastic bag.
