## Description from Original Source

NOT for books, as I first thought.  
Probably meant instead for exchanging 
seeds and seedlings.  
Like a big birdhouse, not high off the ground. Labelled 'Flower [illegible] House' and 
'The Giving House'.  Open to the weather.
—Added to map by K.D., 2023 9 23.
Clarified 2023 9 30.  
Address confirmed 2023 11 16.  Thanks, M.S.
