Community bulletin board / book exchange 
in a little park like a traffic island,
which is ~35 m long.  
Between Cambie and Main Streets.  
Also, they have a giant 'Community Chess and Checkers' set to play with.
That is left of the book exchange
in the first photo above (looking s.).
See the red and blue chess pieces in the photos.
The chess pieces might be gone.  
Bring your own.  Or checkers.

The structure holding the books has no front barrier, and is open all around.  Books get wet, so please put each dry book you donate into its own clear plastic bag.
The assumed address is 2 E. 18th Ave., but no known address is official or posted.
