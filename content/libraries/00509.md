'Free Swap' run by the city government.
Next date to be announced.
Outdoors at Riley Park.
Accepted items include books, clothing, housewares, art, & small electronics. Bring no more than 2 items and take as many as you’d like! Very small event with severe restrictions because this is just for show, to pretend to be green. They are making a very tiny dent in the waste avalanche, as I have said to them.

They claim that not many of left-over books will be destroyed. Why any?
