# Library Import Entry

This library was created by importing data from "Neighbourhood book exchanges 2025.8.6" - a comprehensive map of little free libraries and book exchanges in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Original Data

- **Source**: Vancouver Little Libraries KML dataset
- **Style**: icon-503-FF8277-labelson
- **Status**: Inactive/Uncertain
- **Import Date**: August 8, 2025

## Description from Original Source

At the top of the stairs, to the w. of the stairs, climbing up from Great Northern Way.
From the n., from Foley St., walk w. a few paces and then s. up the long staircase.  
From the s., go n. from Prince Albert St.  
It is aligned n. and s. approximately with
E. 5th Ave.  Just e. of building with that address.
Books can get wet, so please donate each dry book in its own water-proof clear plastic bag.  Under shade of trees, so it might help to take a flashlight, even in the daytime, if it's cloudy and dark.
