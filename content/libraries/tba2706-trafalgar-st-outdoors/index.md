A Reuse and Recycling Drop-off Event.
They take books, but many book donations are made into paper pulp instead. To make sure that doesn't happen, do NOT donate them here. But they will GIVE you some books from the tiny free table, if any books are there. Also, if you are sweet and persistent, they might even let you take some books from the bin to be pulped. That bin includes all the magazines, plus every book which lacks a bar-code, which started in the 1970s. Also to be saved by you from the pulp bin are textbooks, encyclopedias, slightly damaged books, catalogues, journals for writing in, etc.

They write, 'Bring your unwanted electronics, small appliances, clothing and more to our FREE event.' Almost all the re-usable stuff they get is donated to the Salvation Army, which recycles, dumps, or destroys what they can't sell.

These events are usually on the last or second-to-last Saturdays of most months: see other venues with green markers on this map. Check list in left column for other locations which have green markers. (I'll add more.)
