## Description from Original Source

2 bl. s. of Venables St.  Not 1700 Napier St.
'Salsbury Garden Book House.'  Named after “Salsbury Garden”, which was, until 2006, a tiny much-loved semi-public space on this corner.
 The little book house was built by Steve Holmes.
 Grand Opening was March 8, 2015. 
Steve installed a Canadian flag on top of it in the horrible summer of 2025, the summer of Trump and all his 51st state hoo-hah.  
For which, see the second (newer) photo.
The crow is “Crovid”, our neighbourhood mascot.
