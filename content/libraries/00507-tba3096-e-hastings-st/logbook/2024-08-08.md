## Description from Original Source

The next one here is to be announced.
Check the list in the left column for other locations, which have green markers.  (I'm adding them.)

'Reuse and Recycling Drop-off Event'
Saturday, 10 am – 1 pm.
Hastings Community Centre.  They take books, but many are recycled to make paper.  To make sure that doesn't happen, do NOT donate them here.  But they will give you some from the tiny free table, if any.   If you are persistent, they might even let you take some from the bin to be pulped.  That bin includes all the magazines, plus every book which lacks a bar-code, which started in the 1970s. Also to be saved by you from the pulp bin are textbooks, encyclopedias, slightly damaged books, catalogues, journals for writing in, etc.
'Bring your unwanted electronics, small appliances, clothing and more to our FREE event.'  The vast majority of stuff they get is donated to the Salvation Army, which recycles, dumps, or destroys what they can't sell.
Most months at various venues.
