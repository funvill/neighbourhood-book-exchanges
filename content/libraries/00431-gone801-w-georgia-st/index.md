Little Free Library #71869, Pacific Centre.  
But according to the photos, it was one block s.e.
The steward was the 
Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association (D.V.B.I.A.), which had 
~11 book exchanges in the downtown area.  
(Only 2 of which are showing on this map.  
They have violet-colour markers, 
which means they are gone.)
The D.V.B.I.A. boxes were all removed, 
probably by 2020.
—Added to map and noted gone by K.D.,
