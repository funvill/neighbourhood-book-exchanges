Little Free Library #8963.  In the middle of Railspur Park on Granville Island.  Its post is a little wobbly, so be gentle!  
Notes by K.D.:  The location is correct on this map, with a guessed address.  It was on other maps as a block w. of where it actually is.  
It is NOT at 1286 Cartwright Street or 
1360 Johnston St.
The official park address is 1249 Cartwright St.
