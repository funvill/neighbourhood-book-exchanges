Go n.e. on Bessborough Dr. to the last house on your left, which is 4871, and then go ~42 m farther into the woods on the path. Look to your left.
That is the the western segment of Bessborough Dr., just n.e. of the corners of Eton St. and Brisbane Crescent.. 
Or maybe n.w. from the n.w. end of N. Delta Ave. (western fork). 
That is n. of Eton St., ~6 blocks n. of ~4800 Hastings St., in n. Burnaby.
 Another map says it's a free store.
