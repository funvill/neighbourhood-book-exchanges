Picnic tables. Next to free food pantry. 
 Main—Fraser St.  
Corrected:  not at 659 E. 52nd Ave. nor at
660 E. 52nd Ave., although those addresses are wrongly stated by the church on their 2 signs and by Google.   
Rather, it's a block north, on E. 51st.
Not on the e. side of Fraser St., either.
—Added to map by K.D., 2020.
