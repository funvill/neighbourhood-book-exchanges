## Description from Original Source

A little 'free store' inside Spartacus Books (a store selling books).  The 'free store' part is a bookcase with a handful of free books, also shoes, etc.  Such small items only.
For you to give and take, presumably.  
Outside on the front sidewalk under the awning is a rolling bookcase with 6 shelves and books sold BY DONATION.  The rest of the books in the store have marked or set prices.  
They specialize in politics, social change, etc.
They are probably a non-profit group.
Masks required indoors.  
Mon-Fri 10 am-8:30 pm; Sat-Sun 11 am-7 pm.
New location of this wonderful old book store.
