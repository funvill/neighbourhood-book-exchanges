Active, 3 shelfs, wooden, books, unique designs, Great design

Named after “Salsbury Garden”, which was, until 2006, a tiny much-loved semi-public space on this corner. The little book house was built by Steve Holmes. Steve installed a Canadian flag on top of it in the horrible summer of 2025, the summer of Trump and all his 51st state hoo-hah. The crow is “Crovid”, our neighbourhood mascot.
