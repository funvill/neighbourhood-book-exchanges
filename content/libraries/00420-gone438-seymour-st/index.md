The Little Free Library steward for this one was the Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association (D.V.B.I.A.), which had ~11 book exchanges in the downtown area.  
The boxes were all removed, probably by 2020.
This one was the last one on the LFL map.  
It was removed from their map 2021 8 18~.
Few of those old locations are on this map.
