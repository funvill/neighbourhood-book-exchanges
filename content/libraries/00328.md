Active, 2 shelfs, 1 larger self, wooden, books, needs repair

At the top of the stairs, to the w. of the stairs, climbing up from Great Northern Way. From the n., from Foley St., walk w. a few paces and then s. up the long staircase.  From the s., go n. from Prince Albert St.

It is aligned n. and s. approximately with E. 5th Ave.  Just east of building with that address.

Under shade of trees, so it might help to take a flashlight, even in the daytime, if it's cloudy and dark.
