The one pictured here was in bad condition, so it was removed and then repaired and enlarged or replaced.  It is now back in use.  It is big.
Nanaimo—Renfrew St.
‘Community Book Exchange’ in Hastings-Sunrise neighbourhood.
It is not 1/2 block s., as on another map, 
nor is it at 2592 or 2590 William St.
Nor is it on the s. side of the street, as wrongly shown on this Google Map.
