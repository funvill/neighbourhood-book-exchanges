# Library Import Entry

This library was created by importing data from "Neighbourhood book exchanges 2025.8.6" - a comprehensive map of little free libraries and book exchanges in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Original Data

- **Source**: Vancouver Little Libraries KML dataset
- **Style**: icon-503-62AF44-labelson
- **Status**: Inactive/Uncertain
- **Import Date**: August 8, 2025

## Description from Original Source

Next date here to be announced.  
These outdoor events move around the city.
Saturday, 10 am-1 pm.
King George Secondary School parking lot, in the West End. 

A Reuse and Recycling Drop-off Event.
They take books, but many book donations are made into paper pulp instead. To make sure that doesn't happen, do NOT donate them here. But they will GIVE you some books from the tiny free table, if any books are there. Also, you can take books from the bin to be pulped. That bin includes all the magazines, plus every book which lacks a bar-code, which started in the 1970s. Also to be saved by you are textbooks, encyclopedias, slightly damaged books, catalogues, journals for writing in, etc.

They write, 'Bring your unwanted electronics, small appliances, clothing and more to our FREE event.' Almost all the reusable stuff they get is donated to the Salvation Army, which recycles, dumps, or destroys what they can't sell.

These events are usually on the last or second-to-last Saturdays of most months: see other venues with green markers on this map. Check list in left column for other locations which have green markers. (I'll add more.)
