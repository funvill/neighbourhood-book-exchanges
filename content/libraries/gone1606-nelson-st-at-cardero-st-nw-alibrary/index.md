Alibrary is gone.  Let's hope it returns!  
Or another one.
I know not who erected it.
It was very popular, the busiest free book exchange in Vancouver.  Great location.
On Cardero Street at the lane (alley) on the s.e. corner of the Nelson St. property.  (Assuming Nelson St. is e.-w.)
Comox—Nelson streets.  
Across from 1024 Cardero St. 
On the n.w. corner of Henshaw Lane (the 'alley' in 'Alibrary', I guess).  
Pronounced alley - brary, I guess, because it was on the corner of an alley (lane).
CDs and other media were also welcome.  Medium size.  Since those photos were taken, the box had been re-painted and the coloured chalk had washed off the road.
