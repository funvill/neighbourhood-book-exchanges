# Library Import Entry

This library was created by importing data from "Neighbourhood book exchanges 2025.8.6" - a comprehensive map of little free libraries and book exchanges in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Original Data

- **Source**: Vancouver Little Libraries KML dataset
- **Style**: icon-503-93D7E8-labelson
- **Status**: Inactive/Uncertain
- **Import Date**: August 8, 2025

## Description from Original Source

This book exchange is just over the civic border in Burnaby, BC, not in Vancouver, BC.  3 bl. n. of Hastings St.; Boundary Rd.—Esmond Ave. 
On a humorous note, Google Maps wrongly says in the note below that this site is in Vancouver.  The truth, instead, is that it is in Burnaby, BC.
—Original notes added to by K.D., 2020~ and later.
