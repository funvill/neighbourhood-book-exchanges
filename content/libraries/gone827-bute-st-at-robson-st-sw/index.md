The area has a lot of road wrork where the box was.  Maybe it will be put back later.  

2 blocks s. of W. Hastings St.; Denman—Burrard St.; in front of Ebisu restaurant on the s. edge of their property by the kerb in the street with the street tables and chairs.  
Across from 812 Bute St.
Open front, so books might get wet, so please donate each dry book in its own clear plastic bag.  
It is a fairly deep box, so please push the books to the back so the rain is less likely to wet them.
