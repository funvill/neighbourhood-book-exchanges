~2 bl. n. of E. 5th; w. of Fraser St.
	Great Northern Way, a.k.a. Central Valley Greenway. The box says CDM (sponsored by the Centre for Digital Media). Just s.w. of Kafka’s 
	business, which has the 577 address, outdoors on campus. The book box is there 	and CDM is in the next building a bit to the e. at 685 Great Northern Way.
