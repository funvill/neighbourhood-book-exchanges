'Community Pantry': 2 separate outdoor structures ~5 m apart.  Outside of the Vine St. entrance to Kitsilano Neighbourhood House.  
By benches.
The north one has a strict list of items allowed.  Books are not allowed.  
The south one has a working fridge and wooden shelves, all accepting and offering qualifying food.  
There in the south box are sometimes books and other items, too, like a free store, but not labelled as such.
