# Placeholder for Library Image

This is a text placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual image file (placeholder-library.jpg) showing a generic little free library icon or photo.

The image should be approximately 800x600 pixels and show a friendly, welcoming little free library structure.
