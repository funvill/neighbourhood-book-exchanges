# Placeholder Library Image

This is a temporary placeholder for library photos. The actual placeholder-library.jpg image should be created and placed in the public/images/libraries/ directory.

Suggested image content:
- A simple illustration of a little free library box
- Neutral colors (maybe a wooden box with books visible)
- Size: 400x300 pixels recommended
- Format: JPEG or PNG

This text file serves as a reminder until the actual image is created.
